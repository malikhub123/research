# 🌍 Earthquake Magnitude Prediction using Regression Models

## 📖 Overview
This project aims to predict the **magnitude of earthquakes** using various **machine learning regression algorithms**. By analyzing geological and environmental parameters, the model helps identify potential earthquake intensities for early disaster assessment and response.



## 🧠 Objective
The primary goal is to **build and evaluate regression models** that can accurately predict earthquake magnitudes based on given features. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and performance evaluation.



## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab  



## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Loaded the dataset containing geological and earthquake-related parameters.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Performed feature scaling and encoding where necessary.  
   - Engineered features to improve model performance.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualized data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
   - Identified key correlations among features.

4. **Model Building:**  
   - Implemented multiple regression algorithms including:  
     - Linear Regression  
     - Decision Tree Regressor  
     - Random Forest Regressor  
     - Logistic Regression (for magnitude classification)

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as:  
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
     - R² Score  

6. **Model Comparison:**  
   - Compared models to identify the best-performing one based on accuracy and error rate.



## 📊 Results
- Achieved **over 90% prediction accuracy** using Random Forest Regressor.  
- Data visualization provided key insights into influential features affecting earthquake magnitudes.
